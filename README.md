 This site will serve as my new personal portfolio, revamping with all my current experiences and utilizing a much more responsive UI.

I didn't like the state of my old site so I decided to spend my time off school creating a clean and responsive design. My main goals with this site is getting to the incorporation of 3D aspects of web development while also keeping the design responsive for multiple breakpoints (namely desktop and phones). I also want to make it easy to follow and not too abstract as that would be much more of a detriment than something worth doing. Anything added below is something I deemed to be worth adding in my own way to some part of my site:

1. Cards with light moving around the edges:

2. Minimalistic navbar, appearing on scroll up and page load:


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
