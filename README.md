 This site will serve as my new personal portfolio, revamping with all my current experiences and utilizing a much more responsive UI.

I didn't like the state of my old site so I decided to spend my time off school creating a clean and responsive design. My main goals with this site is getting to the incorporation of 3D aspects of web development while also keeping the design responsive for multiple breakpoints (namely desktop and phones). I also want to make it easy to follow and not too abstract as that would be much more of a detriment than something worth doing.

Some of the components I was particularly interested in using include:

- Floating 'pill' navbar that only shows when entering page or scrolling up
- Something in the background/graphics that add to the aesthetic of the landing screen
- An interactive yet clean timeline that lays out the content with an easy to follow format
- Some kind of carousel to display the projects, adding git links and a more info section

In the creation of this site, I used a couple tutorials to get me up to speed on many of the things that react makes easy/efficient, and was also introduced to typescript, which was honestly a great decision as the security provided by the type definitions was great.
